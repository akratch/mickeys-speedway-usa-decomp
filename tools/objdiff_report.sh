# Objects with a Makefile POSTPROCESS override (trim_elf_section.py leaves a
# .text section header shorter than the ELF's own symbol table expects;
# normalize_elf_instructions.py similarly rewrites individual words after the
# fact) are excluded via tools/objdiff_exclude.txt -- objdiff-cli's report
# generator aborts the *entire* batch on the first such object it can't parse
# ("Section symbol without section", or for some, an unattributed "Symbol
# data out of bounds" with no file name at all to key a targeted exclusion
# off of). 686 of this project's ~832 C objects carry a POSTPROCESS override
# (`grep -c ': POSTPROCESS' Makefile`), which is most of the overlay tree.
#
# tools/objdiff_exclude.txt is derived (a grep over the Makefile, nothing
# ROM-derived) but gitignored rather than committed: it's ~700 lines of
# nothing but object-file basenames, which reads as high-entropy text to
# tools/cleanroom_detectors.py's base64-volume heuristic (a real false
# positive on this specific file shape, not a loophole -- see
# docs/CLEANROOM.md). Regenerated fresh on every run instead, before
# objdiff.json (which reads it).
