"""Synthesize an overlay object's relocation surface from the shipped tables.

Background
----------
An overlay module ships *unrelocated*: `runlinkDownloadCode` patches every
site named by the module's own `reloc1`/`reloc2` tables after the DMA.  What
the ROM image therefore stores at a relocation site is not the final address
but the record's **stored addend** -- the value the runtime adds its base to.
`docs/overlays.md` sections 5.1-5.4 establish that model; this tool is its
mechanical consequence.

A C translation unit compiled for an overlay cannot express those addends: IDO
emits an ordinary `R_MIPS_26` / `R_MIPS_HI16` + `R_MIPS_LO16` reference to a
symbol, and the symbol has no address in this build because it lives in a
different module (or in a section the runtime places).  The project's answer
is a placeholder extern (`overlay1Chain0Reloc`, `D_0210`, ...) whose *value*
is then supplied as a linker-script assignment in
`overlay_undefined_syms.us.txt`, so that the linked instruction word carries
exactly the stored addend the retail image carries.

That value is not a judgement call.  For a candidate whose instruction
schedule already agrees with the target, every placeholder's value is
**readable from the ROM at the site the relocation names**:

    R_MIPS_26   value = SYNTHETIC_VMA | (stored_imm26 << 2)
    HI16/LO16   value = (stored_hi16 << 16) + sign_extend16(stored_lo16)

This tool reads a compiled object, maps each of its undefined-symbol
relocations back to a module text offset, reads the shipped word from the
baserom, and prints the linker-script assignments (and, with --makefile, the
equivalent objcopy spec).  It also cross-checks each site against the decoded
module relocation table, which is what distinguishes a genuine relocation
site from a literal the compiler must not relocate.

Nothing ROM-derived is written: the baserom and the atlas are read at run
time and only *addresses and symbol values already required by the link* are
emitted.

    """(renames, refusals) for this object's calls to *resident* functions.

    An overlay module ships unrelocated, and §5.2's census says a `SYMBOL`
    `R_MIPS_26` record stores immediate zero whether its target is another
    module or the resident segment: the shipped word is `jal 0` and the runtime
    patches it.  So a resident call needs exactly the same addend every other
    cross-module call needs, `0xF0000000`, and nothing about it is special --
    except its *name*.

    Adopted C spells the call with splat's resident auto-name (`func_80029FE4`),
    and that name is global.  Assigning it in `overlay_undefined_syms.us.txt`
    does not give the overlay an addend, it moves the resident function for
    every resident caller as well: `func_80034448` is called from `models.c`,
    `level.c`, `menu.c` and four asm objects, and a value line for it turns all
    of them into `relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_26`.  That is the whole of
    the `resident-symbol-missing` and `relocation-truncated` classes.

    The fix is the one the hand-written POSTPROCESS rules already use (overlay
    49 rebinds `func_800254FC` to `overlay65UpdateReloc`): give the *site* a
    per-module placeholder name and value that.  This derives the same rebind
    mechanically -- one alias per (resident name, module) -- so the resident
    name keeps its real address and the overlay keeps its stored addend.

    Only `R_MIPS_26` sites are aliased.  A resident *data* reference stores the
    real resident address in its HI16/LO16 pair, so valuing it under its own
    name is already correct and already what the surface does (`D_80000040 =
    0x80000040`); renaming those would churn the file for no change in bytes.

# ------------------------------------------------- permuter target annotation
#
# decomp-permuter scores a candidate object against a *target object* it
# assembles from splat's .s.  For an overlay function that comparison is
# invalid, and the reason is the same one section 1 gives: the shipped image
# stores addends, not addresses, so splat's .s assembles with no relocations
# at all.  Every cross-module call reads back as `jal <whatever symbol sits at
# module offset 0>` (the SYMBOL records all store immediate zero) and every
# address materialization as a bare `lui`/`addiu` pair carrying the stored
# addend.  The candidate object, compiled from C, carries an honest
# `R_MIPS_26` / `%hi`+`%lo` reference to a placeholder extern instead.
#
# The scorer's own symbol-difference rule cannot bridge that: it ignores a
# field mismatch only when the candidate's field looks like a symbol *and*
# the target line carries a relocation (scorer.py `field_matches_any_symbol(nf)
# and old_line.has_symbol`), and the target line carries none.  So a candidate
# that differs from the shipped ROM by two words scored 700 -- one insertion
# plus one deletion penalty for every relocation site in the function.
#
# The fix is not to relax the scorer but to give the target the relocations
# the shipped module says are there.  The module's own reloc1/reloc2 tables
# name every site and its type, and for a SYMBOL record they name the callee
# (overlay + offset) outright; that is a *stable identity*, independent of any
# name this tree happens to have chosen.  So:
#
#   * for each relocation the candidate's base object carries inside the
#     function, map its object offset to a module offset and look the site up
#     in the module's table.  A site the table does not name is not a
#     relocation site in the shipped image and is left alone (section 2);
#   * derive a canonical name for the *base symbol* from the record --
#     `__ovsym_o<overlay>_<offset>` for a SYMBOL record, `__ovjmp_<offset>`
#     for an intra-module JUMP, `__ovloc_<value>` for a LOCAL/DATA site whose
#     value the ROM spells at the site -- subtracting whatever addend the
#     object already carries, exactly as `synthesize()` does;
#   * rewrite the target .s line to reference that name symbolically, and
#     rename the candidate's placeholder to the same name with
#     `objcopy --redefine-sym`.
#
# Both sides then render identically at every corroborated site, so the score
# reflects only real codegen difference -- and a candidate that calls the
# *wrong* placeholder still scores a penalty, because the canonical name comes
# from the ROM's record, not from the candidate's own symbol table.
#
# Nothing here writes ROM-derived content anywhere: the rewritten .s lives in
# the permuter's gitignored scratch, exactly like the label rename
# permute_batch.py already performs.
