 *   0x08 textSize        TrapDanglingJump, `lw v0, 0x8(t1)` at ROM 0x34004,
 *                        added to vramBase to form the end of the overlay's
 *                        resident range
 *   0x14 relocTableSize  TrapDanglingJump, `lh t4, 0x14(t1)` at ROM 0x34008.
 *                        The load is a SIGNED halfword, which is the only
 *                        reason this is `s16` here and `u16` in JFG
 *   0x1C resumeFunction  read twice by runlinkCallResumeFunction (ROM 0x32EB4,
 *                        0x32F18) and compared against -1
 *
 * 0x08 and 0x14 are new in Task D and came from TrapDanglingJump (0x800333A0),
 * which walks the whole table looking for the overlay that contains a given
 * address. vramBase and resumeFunction come from functions that match Mickey's
 * ROM byte for byte, so those two offsets are measured rather than assumed;
 * the two new ones come from disassembly that is read but not yet compiled,
 * which is a slightly weaker thing and is why they are called out separately.
 *
 * The remaining five fields are JFG's names at JFG's offsets and NOTHING IN
 * THIS PROJECT HAS TOUCHED THEM YET. They are present rather than commented
 * out because the struct has to be 0x20 bytes for the indexing to compile
 * correctly, but treat each one as unverified until a matched function reads
 * it. (An earlier version of this comment claimed they were "left commented",
 * which was simply wrong about its own code.)

 *                                     index into RomTableEntry[]
 *
 * THIS IS NOT JFG'S LAYOUT, and the difference is worth stating rather than
 * smoothing over. JFG's table entry is two plain words, `{u32 functionAddress;
 * u32 overlayIndex;}`. Mickey's has the two words in the opposite order AND
 * packs the address: it stores a 24-bit byte offset from 0x80000450 in the
 * high bits of the second word rather than a whole 32-bit address. This struct
 * is therefore derived entirely from Mickey's ROM; only the type's NAME is
 * JFG's.
 *
 * The low 8 bits of the second word are shifted away by the only code that
 * reads them, so nothing here establishes what they hold. They are named
 * `unused` for want of evidence, not because emptiness was demonstrated -- and
 * the table itself lives in the unmapped overlay region, so they cannot be
 * inspected until Phase 4 splits it.
