/*
 * NONMATCHING-notes for this whole file: the toolchain cannot emit the ROM's
 * floating-point register allocation.
 *
 * The ROM's float code uses ODD single-precision FP registers -- $f5, $f7,
 * $f9, $f11 and $f17 all appear in the 53 instructions at 0x8002AF6C alone.
 * At the project's flags the IDO 5.3 in tools/ido/ emits none: a four-term
 * dot-product test case compiled at every combination of -mips1/-mips2/-mips3
 * with -O1/-O2/-O3 produced zero odd single-precision FP registers in all nine
 * builds. Every candidate below therefore comes out using $f0/$f2/$f4/... and
 * differs from the ROM in almost every FP register name, with the instruction
 * schedule following from that. (It CAN emit them, under
 * -Wc,-mips3 -Wc,-fp32regs -- just not the ROM's ones. See below.)
 *
 * ROM-wide the evidence is 1727 odd FP register operands across 9 of the
 * static segment's asm files, out of 24984 FP operands in total. The GNU
 * assembler notices too: assembling asm/18FF0.s prints "Warning: float
 * register should be even" once per occurrence.
 *
 * WHAT IS SETTLED. No SGI IDO build can produce the ROM's allocation, and the
 * search for one is closed -- see docs/modules.md section 6.2 for the
 * mechanism. In short: this IDO's ugen does have SGI's -fp32regs, reachable as
 * `-Wc,-mips3 -Wc,-fp32regs` (the -Wo, form earlier sweeps used hands the flag
 * to uopt, which drops it), and with it MatrixMultiplyVec4 comes out at the
 * ROM's exact 53 instructions with odd registers -- but allocated across all
 * 32, including argument, return and unsaved callee-saved odd halves, where
 * the ROM confines itself to $f4-$f11 and $f16-$f18. That is structural: in
 * the matched decompilation of real IDO 7.1's ugen, -fp32regs is an
 * unconditional loop freeing all 16 odd registers, while the reservation logic
 * that protects live ones walks even register numbers only. Six IDO/MIPSpro
 * versions, 4.1 through 7.4.4, all choose the same all-32 set.
 *
 * So (a) is dead. Two explanations remain, and they are not exclusive:
 *
 *   (b) HAND-WRITTEN ASSEMBLY. Odd-register use is exactly what a human
 *       writing MIPS by hand produces, because the even-only constraint is a
 *       compiler convention rather than a hardware one here. This is NOT
 *       ruled out for these two functions and it is the cheapest thing to
 *       check first, because it would make them un-decompilable by design
 *       rather than blocked on a compiler. The per-file odd-operand density
 *       is NOT uniform, which is what a single-compiler story would predict:
 *
 *         61.3%  796/1299  asm/59DB0.s   <- rule this one out first
 *         50.0%   38/76    asm/4FC30.s
 *         43.5%   37/85    asm/59BF0.s
 *         40.1%  254/633   asm/nonmatchings/main/matrix/   <- THIS FILE
 *         24.2%  266/1100  asm/18FF0.s
 *         18.9%  252/1335  asm/2A250.s
 *         12.1%   44/365   asm/3B480.s
 *          2.9%    6/209   asm/33FA0.s
 *          2.7%   34/1257  asm/16140.s
 *
 *       A spread from 61% to 2.7% across nine files looks more like a mix of
 *       origins than like one allocator applied uniformly. Note where this
 *       file sits: 40%. That is high enough that hand-written assembly is a
 *       live explanation for the two functions below specifically, not just
 *       for the ROM in general -- and if it is the right one, they are
 *       un-decompilable by design and no compiler will fix them.
 *
 *   (c) A NON-IDO COMPILER for some or all of the game code. No positive
 *       evidence anywhere points at one; it is listed because nothing rules
 *       it out, not because anything suggests it.
 *
 * DO NOT re-sweep compiler flags or IDO versions for this file. The mechanism
 * above says in advance that every such sweep fails. What would reopen it is
 * named in docs/modules.md section 6.2, and neither item is something to wait
 * for.
 *
 * What IS believed correct is the C. Both bodies were derived from the ROM's
 * own multiply/add chains and reproduce the arithmetic exactly, and
 * MatrixMultiplyVec4 under -Wc,-mips3 -Wc,-fp32regs reproduces the ROM's
 * instruction count and kinds exactly, differing only in register names. Do
 * not rewrite them from scratch.
 *
 * func_8002B040 (MatrixRotateVec3) does not belong to this discussion at all:
 * it uses no odd registers. Its blocker is ugen's expression scheduling, and
 * with the stock toolchain at uopt -O3 -- reachable only through
 * tools/ido-phases.py, since `cc -O3` dies in uld -- and the m[i][j]*x operand
 * order it is 16 of 34 instructions from a match, with two systematic
 * residuals: the final add.s operand order (the ROM writes the accumulator
 * first) and the third mul.s's placement in rows 2 and 3.
