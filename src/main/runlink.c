/*
 * The runtime overlay linker -- ROM 0x323E0-0x33FA0 (VRAM 0x800317E0).
 *
 * Identified from its diagnostic strings (ROM 0x83018-0x83087), which are
 * byte-identical to the ones in Jet Force Gemini's public decomp of the same
 * Rare/DKR-lineage linker. See include/game/runlink.h for the field evidence
 * behind the structs.
 *
 * PROVENANCE -- read this before changing anything here.
 *
 * The bodies in this file are ADAPTED FROM JFG's public decomp of the same
 * engine, not written from scratch. JFG's runLink.c was open in front of me
 * while these were written, and the resemblance goes well past the names: the
 * signatures, the parameter names, the local names and in most cases the
 * declaration order are JFG's. That is a permitted source under
 * docs/CLEANROOM.md (a published, retail-derived decompilation), and it is
 * stated here rather than left for a reader to infer from the similarity.
 *
 * What makes that adaptation *sound* for every function below except one is
 * that each is validated by byte-identity against Mickey's own ROM: the
 * compiled C reproduces Mickey's instructions exactly, so JFG's shape is not
 * being taken on trust, it is being confirmed against this game's binary.
 * Where Mickey's ROM disagreed with JFG, Mickey won and the deviation is
 * recorded:
 *
 *   - MipsInstruction's field order is corrected. JFG names the halfword at
 *     offset 0x00 `immediate` and the one at 0x02 `upper`; Mickey's `sh` at
 *     offset 0x02 patches the I-type immediate, which is the *low* half of a
 *     big-endian word, so the names are swapped here to match the hardware.
 *   - runlinkCallResumeFunction's pending-load scan is a do/while over a
 *     counter initialised to 15, read off Mickey's `addiu a0, zero, 0xF` at
 *     ROM 0x32ED8, not JFG's ARRAY_COUNT-driven while loop.
 *   - The struct layouts in include/game/runlink.h are re-derived from
 *     Mickey's instruction offsets; only OverlayHeader carries fields this
 *     project has not yet touched, and the header says which those are.
 *
 * The one function without that backstop is ProcessRelocationEntry, which is
 * parked non-matching. Its provenance note is attached to it directly, because
 * for that one the adaptation is load-bearing and unverified.
 *
 * Flags: -O2 -mips2 -32. The -O2 is the project default; the -mips2 is a
 * measured deviation and the first evidence about how GAME code (as opposed to
 * libultra) was built. ResolveRelocAddress's `lw t7,0(a3)` at ROM 0x32534 is
 * followed immediately by `addu v1,v1,t7`, using the loaded register in the
 * next instruction. At -mips1 IDO's assembler pads every such pair with a
 * load-delay nop; five of them appeared across this file before the Makefile
 * gained its src/main/ MIPSISET override.

#ifdef NON_MATCHING
/*
 * ProcessRelocationEntry -- PARKED, not matched. ROM 0x32630-0x32878.
 *
 * Applies one relocation record and returns how many records it consumed: a
 * HI16 record needs its matching LO16 to know whether the low half will sign
 * extend, so mode 5 reads the next record too and returns 2, everything else
 * returns 1. The body below is complete and believed semantically right; what
 * it does not reproduce is IDO's register allocation.
 *
 * NONMATCHING-notes:
 *
 *  - Residual after fifteen source variants: verdict=structure-mismatch,
 *    words=126, regs=121, insns=147 against the ROM's 146, with a 0x48-byte
 *    candidate frame against the target's 0x40. Measured with
 *    `decomp-workbench diagnose-dumps` plus two `campaign` runs, 8 variants
 *    then 7, both recorded in the one ledger named below. The brief's parking
 *    rule asked for five campaigns; two were run. See the report.
 *
 *  - The single mechanical cause, named by the workbench's web analysis:
 *    web `a3->s1`, count 8. The ROM keeps `patchLocation` in a temp register
 *    and caller-saves it around the ResolveRelocAddress call (`sw a3,0x3c(sp)`
 *    at 0x32690, `lw a3,0x3c(sp)` at 0x326A4); every candidate instead
 *    promotes it to the callee-saved s1. That costs one `sw s1` in the
 *    prologue and one `lw s1` in the epilogue -- the entire instruction-count
 *    delta -- and every downstream register name shifts with it. The ROM
 *    promotes exactly one value to a callee-saved register, `relocEntry` in
 *    s0, and stack-homes five locals: op at 0x24, nextPatchLocation at 0x30,
 *    resolvedAddr at 0x34, mode at 0x38, patchLocation at 0x3c.
 *
 *  - Variants tried, all ranked by the campaign at
 *    .decomp-workbench/campaigns/ProcessRelocationEntry-5073763cae48/:
 *      baseline                                        words=126
 *      no separate hi-immediate local                  words=128
 *      patchLocation declared first among locals       words=128
 *      patchLocation declared last among locals        words=127
 *      mode/op unsigned rather than signed             words=126 (identical object)
 *      &base[index] rather than base + index           words=126 (identical object)
 *      field-guide lever 7, a code-free `if (g) {}`    words=144 (worse)
 *    Second run, the temp-fifo-phase playbook and the branch-likely lead:
 *      lever 14, call argument hoisted to a local      words=126 (identical object)
 *      lever 14 + the hoist reused for the lookups     words=129
 *      lever 15, phantom pop in a real `if`            words=147 (worse)
 *      lever 16, redundant assembler-folded mask       words=148 (worse)
 *      two nested `if`s rather than one `&&`           words=126 (identical object)
 *      nested `if`s + lever 14 together                words=126 (identical object)
 *    Declaration order moves the pool but never demotes patchLocation out of
 *    s1, and six variants across the two runs produced objects byte-identical
 *    to the baseline -- the front end canonicalizes those spellings away
 *    before the allocator ever sees them.
 *
 *  - What was ruled out. The extra instruction is NOT a missing/extra
 *    statement: opcode multisets agree everywhere except the s1 save/restore
 *    pair, and the constant sites the workbench flags are all frame offsets
 *    shifted by that same save. It is also not the flags nibble: the mode and
 *    operation reads match the ROM instruction for instruction.
 *
 *  - Three leads, all now TRIED AND DEAD, recorded so nobody repeats them.
 *    (1) The ROM emits `bnezl` at 0x326F4/0x3270C where every candidate emits
 *    `bnez`, which suggested the guard was two nested `if`s rather than one
 *    `&&`. It is not: the nested form compiles to an object byte-identical to
 *    the `&&` form, so the branch-likely selection is downstream of the
 *    allocation problem, not a cause of it. (2) The temp-fifo-phase playbook
 *    (levers 14-16) is the documented lever for this class and does not move
 *    it -- hoisting the call argument to a local before the divergence is
 *    another byte-identical object, and levers 15 and 16 both regress. (3) A
 *    fresh 119-combination flag sweep and an explicit `-O2 -g0 -mips2 -32`
 *    schedule probe both retain the stock 147-instruction, 126-word object;
 *    `-O2 -g3` regresses to 128 words.
 *
 *  - What is left to try, for the next person. The allocation decision is
 *    uopt's, so only the unsampled pool-position family (8-13) remains. Failing
 *    that, this is a candidate for the compiler-identity question that
 *    src/main/matrix.c raises: if the float code says this ROM was not built by
 *    the IDO 5.3 in tools/ido/, then an allocator difference in integer code is
 *    exactly the second symptom that hypothesis predicts, and no amount of
 *    source rewriting will close it.
 *
 * The C is kept, under NON_MATCHING, rather than deleted -- but see the
 * provenance note above before trusting it. It is the best available reading
 * of the function, not a verified one.
 */
/*
 * Apply one relocation record, and report how many records were consumed.
 *
 * A HI16 record needs its matching LO16 to know whether the low half will sign
 * extend, so mode 5 reads the *next* record too and returns 2; everything else
 * returns 1. The caller's loop advances by the return value.
 *
 * PROVENANCE -- this body is ADAPTED FROM JFG's public decomp, and it is the
 * one function in this file where that matters.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed the body was "written from
 * Mickey's ROM rather than adapted: same name, independently derived code."
 * That was false and has been corrected. The body follows JFG's
 * ProcessRelocationEntry statement for statement -- same control flow, same
 * `>= 0xFFC` clamp, same sign-extension of the low half, same guard before
 * the unresolved-symbol substitution, same terminal flags expression in all
 * three exits. The reasoning that produced the false claim was that JFG ships
 * its version as non-matching, so mine "had to be" independent. That does not
 * follow: an unvalidated implementation is still the thing I read and
 * followed.
 *
 * Why this one matters more than the rest of the file: every other function
 * here is checked by byte-identity against Mickey's ROM, which converts a
 * borrowed shape into a verified one. This function is parked non-matching, so
 * it has no such backstop. Its correctness currently rests on JFG agreement
 * plus my reading of Mickey's asm -- and JFG agreement is NOT evidence about
 * Mickey, because JFG's own version is unvalidated too. Treat every statement
 * below as a hypothesis about Mickey until the function matches.
 *
 * VALIDATION MUST COME FROM MICKEY'S ASM. The disassembly is at
 * asm/nonmatchings/main/runlink/func_80031A30.s (ROM 0x32630-0x32878). Read it
 * against this body statement by statement before trusting any line; do not
 * treat "JFG does it this way" as a reason for anything.
 *
 * One inherited expression is called out specifically, because a reviewer
 * flagged it as evidence of copying and was right to look:
 * `relocEntry->u.b.flags &= 0xFFF0` masks a u8 field with a 16-bit constant,
 * which is a no-op above bit 7 and reads like a quirk carried over from JFG.
 * It is carried over. It is ALSO corroborated by Mickey's own ROM, which emits
 * `andi ...,0xFFF0` at 0x32668, 0x32790, 0x32830 and 0x32858 -- writing
 * `& 0xF0` instead changes the assembled immediate, so the expression is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Both facts are true at once: it is
 * inherited from JFG *and* it is what Mickey's instruction encodes. Kept, with
 * this note, rather than removed.
