# Mickey's Speedway USA (US) — clean-room decompilation build
#
# This is one ordinary host build graph. Splat describes the ROM layout and
# emits the linker script; matched functions compile from C, unmatched
# functions enter those same C objects through GLOBAL_ASM, and retained data
# enters as extracted binary inputs. A single final link places resident code
# and every overlay back at their original ROM offsets. The game's runtime
# overlay loader is source under src/main/runlink.c, not Make machinery.

# Two-phase build, driven by a fresh recursive $(MAKE) per phase.
#
# Why: a single `make` invocation decides whether build/asm/FOO.s.o needs
# rebuilding by stat()-ing its prerequisites once, in the order they're
# listed on the rule -- `%.s` (normal) comes before `$(SPLAT_STAMP)`
# (order-only), so that stat happens *before* the split recipe (which is
# what actually rewrites %.s) has run, even though make correctly runs the
# order-only prereq's recipe first. Net effect, verified empirically: within
# one invocation, order-only alone does NOT retrigger .o rebuilds after a
# same-invocation re-split -- `gmake` would silently link against
# pre-re-split objects.
#
# The reliable fix is the classic two-pass recursive-make idiom: run the
# split to completion as its own `make` invocation (phase 1), then start a
# genuinely *new* `make` invocation for the real build (phase 2) -- its
# dependency scan stats files from disk fresh, after phase 1's writes, so
# object files correctly see their .s as newer and rebuild. The .o/.elf
# pattern rules below still order-depend on $(SPLAT_STAMP) too, as a
# best-effort guard for anyone invoking a build target directly instead of

# $(SPLAT_STAMP) is a *normal* (not order-only) prerequisite here, unlike the

# not itself listed as a prerequisite of this object (there is no per-TU
# dependency file naming exactly which GLOBAL_ASM paths one .c references).
# Without a real dependency on the stamp, a re-split that renames a symbol
# (splat re-numbers auto names, or a friendly name changes) leaves an
# already-built .c.o holding a stale reference and an incremental build can
# link a mismatched object, or fail outright, while a clean build passes --
# this happened for real when a re-split renamed an assembly symbol while an
# existing object still referenced the old name. Depending on the stamp for
# real means *every*
# .c.o rebuilds after any re-split, not just the ones that reference a moved

# -g3 -mips2: a third, separately verified libultra flag group.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS NOT -- read the two apart, because they are not
# the same strength of claim.
#
#   MEASURED: `-g3` and `-mips2` are both forced by Mickey's bytes. All twelve
#   combinations of {-O0,-O1,-O2} x {with,without -g3} x {-mips1,-mips2} were
#   compiled and compared against ROM 0x730A0 and 0x730F0. Exactly two produce
#   the ROM's 0x48-byte function: `-O1 -g3 -mips2` and `-O2 -g3 -mips2`. Drop
#   -g3 and the function is 0x44; drop -mips2 and it is 0x50 or 0x4C; -O0 gives
#   0x60. (-O3 could not be tested: this IDO recomp build dies in `uld` on any
#   -O3 invocation, an environment failure rather than a fact about the code.)
#
#   ALSO MEASURED, on a later TU: `-O2` rather than `-O1`. epiread and epiwrite
#   are byte-identical at both, so those two files never discriminated the
#   optimisation level and -O2 was borrowed from Jet Force Gemini's published
#   Makefile. `pidma` (ROM 0x6FB90) settles it from Mickey's own bytes: 48
#   instructions at -O2 -g3 -mips2, matching word for word, against 68 at
#   -O1 -g3 -mips2 and 78 at -O0.
#
# What -g3 changes, structurally, confirmed in disassembly: without it IDO
# hoists the third argument's spill (`sw a2,0x28(sp)`) into the first jal's
# delay slot and leaves that slot empty in the ROM's version, and it emits
# `lw ra` before `lw v0` in the epilogue. The ROM does neither.
#
# Reading a permitted public decompilation's build configuration is the same
# permission as reading its source (docs/CLEANROOM.md). The part of this that
# is a fact about MICKEY is the part that was measured here.
#
# Every TU in the list below was measured before it was added, one at a time.
# The list is not "libultra's io/ and pfs/ trees"; it is the set that has been

# -Xphase,uopt,+ -Xphase,uopt,-O1: a FOURTH libultra flag group, and the only

#
# WHY A WRAPPER AT ALL. `tools/ido/cc` runs `uopt` only at -O2 and above --
# checked at -O1 x {-g0,-g1,-g2,-g3,none}, where `cc -v` never lists a uopt
# stage. So the configuration "uopt ran, at -O1" cannot be produced by the
# driver. It cannot be faked with -Wo,-O1 either: -W<pass>,-O<n> is inserted
# BEFORE the driver's own -O and the last -O wins. (ISA options are appended
# after, which is why -Wc,-mips3 below does work and -Wo,-O1 does not.)
#
# ido-phases.py drives cfe/uopt/ugen/as1 itself, taking each phase's command
# line from `cc -v` rather than reimplementing the driver's flag translation,
# so it cannot drift from it. With no -Xphase, option it is byte-identical to
# `cc`: verified on string.c (-O2 -mips2), epidma.c (-O2 -g3 -mips2), si.c
# (-O1 -mips2, where the driver skips uopt), pfsreadwritefile.c (-O2 -g3
# -mips2), and on a GLOBAL_ASM TU under asm-processor.
#
# MEASURED, on setglobalintmask: __osSetGlobalIntMask is byte-identical to ROM
# 0x75080 once uopt has run at -O1 -- 19 of 19 words, with only the six the
# linker fills in differing. Without the uopt stage the same source gives 20
# instructions with the first jal's delay slot empty, which is what the file's
# header used to describe. -g3 is NOT needed (identical with and without);
# -mips2 IS (-mips1 gives 9 of 19); -O2 destroys it (the frame drops to 0x40).
