# Clean-Room Policy

This project aims to be a fully public, legally distributable matching
decompilation. To keep it publishable:

## Never committed to this repository
- ROM images or partial ROM dumps (any region/version)
- Extracted assets, disassembly (`asm/`), or binary blobs derived from a ROM
- Proprietary compiler binaries (IDO) or SDK binaries

## Prohibited knowledge sources
Code, symbol names, comments, or structure may NOT be derived from:
- Any leaked Rare/Nintendo source code
- The leaked Star Fox Adventures debug build (July 2002) or its symbols
- The leaked Dinosaur Planet build or its symbols
- Any other unreleased/leaked build of any game

Contributors who have studied leaked Rare source code should not
contribute matched C implementations.

## Permitted knowledge sources
- Analysis of retail ROMs you legally possess
- Published matching-decomp repositories built from retail ROMs
  (Diddy Kong Racing, Jet Force Gemini, Perfect Dark, Banjo-Kazooie,
  Conker's Bad Fur Day) and their symbol naming
- Official Nintendo 64 SDK documentation and libultra headers as
  distributed in existing public decomp projects
- Emulator tracing/debugging of retail ROMs

## Build inputs
The build requires you to supply your own legally dumped ROM
(`baseroms/`), verified by SHA1 before use.
