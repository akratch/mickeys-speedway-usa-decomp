# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records the decisions the project owner made on 2026-08-24,
drawing on `docs/reference-findings.md`, the survey of what the published N64
decomps (DKR, JFG, BK, PD, dp64) actually do. These
files are the durable record of *what was decided and why*; they are not
re-opened to relitigate a decision, only superseded by a new ADR when the
decision changes.

## Format

Each ADR is one file, `NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered sequentially and never
renumbered or reused. MADR-style, short (the target is 40-90 lines):

```
# NNNN. Title

Status: Accepted | Superseded by NNNN | Deprecated
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What situation forced a decision, and what was actually measured (a
citation to the survey section, a repo, a number) rather than asserted.

## Decision

What was decided, stated as an instruction someone can follow without
having read the context.

## Consequences

What this changes in the tree, what it does not change, and any follow-up
work the decision creates.
```

A decision is written down once it is made; it is not deferred pending
implementation. Where a decision requires code or doc changes elsewhere in
the tree, the ADR says so under Consequences and the follow-up is tracked
the ordinary way (a commit, a campaign entry), not by leaving the ADR
"Proposed."
